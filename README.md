# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

There are many different ways to interpret user needs when developing a program. For me, I like to put myself in the shoes of the user and try to think of everything the user would desire. However, we do have a bias so it is helpful to ask friends and family what they would expect from a program like what I am developing. Creating user stories helps us keep these needs in mind and create deliverables based on these user needs.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to write down what the main goals of the program are. Decide what base functionality is expected when I have finished programming. I then use the agile process of incremental development to slowly add in all of the features I need. I hope to keep this process going because it has worked for me so far and I would like to incorporate more agile processes in the future.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

A good team member in software development contributes as much as they can to the team. They respect the views and responsibilities of other team members and they keep the user needs in mind. They help others with areas of code that they are struggling with as well as seek help for what they are struggling with themselves. They should also be understanding of when others are having a hard time and help in any way that they can.
